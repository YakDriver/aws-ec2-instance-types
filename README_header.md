# aws-ec2-instance-types
AWS instance type offerings (e.g., `t2.micro`, `m2.small`) by region and availability zone. Below you can see every instance type available in each of these regions:

**NOTE:** Availability zones are not consistent from one AWS customer to another. AWS rotates customers and letters to provide an even distribution of usage. For example, `us-west-2b` for one customer might be `us-west-2c` for another. As a result, these offerings are listed by availability zone ID, which is consistent from account to account.
